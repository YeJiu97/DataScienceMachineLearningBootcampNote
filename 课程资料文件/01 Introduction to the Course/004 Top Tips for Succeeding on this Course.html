Why is the code being written? What what are we trying to accomplish? Then pause the video, try and recall what code was written and start to add the code to your own project. This will free you from trying to type along as quickly as possible and allow you to engage and understand the material.</p><p><br></p><h4>Use the Cornell Note-taking system</h4><p>This is a proven way to quickly learn and digest content. The system works by dividing up the note-taking into 3 parts. First, write your notes. Then pick out the most important keywords, and finally summarize what the lesson was about at the end. <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=1RfRLujREfLx1PSpw9bubNDsvRuknJ5ek" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Download the note-taking template here.</a></p><p><br></p><h4>Vary the lesson speed to suit your needs</h4><p>Try double speed if I’m talking too slowly or you find the material simple to understand. Try slower speeds as things get more difficult.</p><p><br></p><h4>Bookmark the difficult parts during the course</h4><p>Mark parts of the course for review so that you can come back to them at a later stage - say after completing the module or having done a little bit of Googling around the topic.</p><p><br></p><h4>Struggle is good</h4><p>A weight lifter has to train hard to build up their muscles. In the same way, it takes practice to get good at data science, programming, and machine learning. And at times, it will be difficult. You will get stuck and run into errors. All of that is part of the process. Don’t get discouraged. Every problem that you’re encountering, someone else will have already encountered and there are usually solutions out there to help you get unstuck. Google and StackOverflow are your friends in the darkest of times. Don’t give up. Keep at it and you will be victorious!</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
